Step 1. Create your own discord bot. Instructions: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token

Step 2. Open src/Commands/Constants.

Step 3. Input your key you got from Step 2 in the "".

Warning! The next few steps require coding knowledge. If you do not understand this you can PM pekkapost for help.

Step 4. Using IdeaProject, go to File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts. Create a jar that should look something like https://imgur.com/hch2mSu. (PekkaBot 2/3 are interchangable)

Step 5. Then go to Build -> Build Artifacts and run the artifact you just created.

Step 6. You now have a runable jar in out/artifacts/PekkaBot3_jar/.

Step 7. Open command promt there and run `java -jar PekkaBot3.jar`.

If step 4 and 5 are too confusing I can build it for you instead. Just send me the key you created and I will make the jar for you.
